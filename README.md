# channel-flow----three-energy
This series of codes is based on the JFM paper 'energy transfer in turbulent channel flows and implications for resolvent modelling'. The flow system to look at is turbulent channel flow (1D mean flow). The dataset used is the P4U-exact-coherent-state solution at friction Reynolds number 85.
Code 'MAIN_kinetic_energy.m' calculates the kinetic energy distribution in Fourier space, reproducing figure 2(a).
Code 'MAIN_three_energy.m' calculates the production, dissipation and nonlinear transfer in Fourier space, reproducing figure 3 in the paper.
